# Custom-Dev-Board
This project focuses on designing and building a custom development board that combines the strengths of the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller and an Espressif Systems ESP32 Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module on a single PCB. The goal is to create a compact, flexible, and cost-effective devboard suitable for IoT, embedded systems.
